11 june 2025 - Issue identifies at work.
----------------------------------------

Issue : OPENQUERY doesn't work inside a dynamic SQL string that you try to execute via EXEC(@sql) inside stored procedure.

Error code : 

create proc procedurename
DECLARE @sql NVARCHAR(MAX)
SET @sql = 'SELECT * FROM OPENQUERY(LINKEDSERVER, ''SELECT * FROM SomeTable'')'
EXEC(@sql)

----------
Fix : 
----------

OPENQUERY needs to be outside of dynamic SQL for SQL Server to compile and execute it.
If youâ€™re building a stored procedure and need dynamic behavior with a linked server, try to parameterize only the inner SELECT, but write the actual OPENQUERY as a static string.

correct code:

create proc procedurename
SELECT * 
FROM OPENQUERY(LINKEDSERVER, 'SELECT * FROM SomeTable')
