****Things to Remember****

1. COUNT(*) counts all rows including NULLs.
2. TRUNCATE removes all rows but keeps structure & resets identity (faster than DELETE).
3. DISTINCT filters out duplicate rows.
4. HAVING filters after aggregation.
5. GROUP BY is used for grouping rows with the same values.
6. DELETE can be filtered using WHERE, logs each row deletion, and retains identity values. 
7. TRUNCATE removes all rows instantly, resets identity, and is not logged row by row.
8. SUM() OVER() provides running total without subqueries using windowing.
9. A non-clustered index improves lookup performance on customer_id.
10. UNION ALL is used in recursive CTEs to combine anchor and recursive members.
11. RANK() gives same rank to ties, ROW_NUMBER() gives unique values.
12. OFFSET-FETCH is the SQL Server way to do efficient pagination.
13. LEFT JOIN includes all rows from the left, NULL for unmatched right.
14. SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employees)   | SELECT TOP 2 salary FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC  | SELECT salary FROM Employees ORDER BY salary DESC OFFSET 1 ROW FETCH NEXT 1 ROW ONLY  : All 3 meothod return 2nd highest salary.
15. A covering index contains all columns needed by the query to avoid extra reads.
16. Table variables do participate in transactions, and can have PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE.
17. Default isolation level in SQL Server is Read Committed.
18. All: unindexed columns, outdated stats, or SELECT * can cause Table Scan
19. OPTION (RECOMPILE) forces recompile each time to avoid parameter sniffing issues.
20. DATEDIFF(ms, start, end) gives milliseconds.
21. NTILE() splits rows into groups. For previous-row comparisons, LAG() is correct.
22. A heap is a table without a clustered index, but it can have non-clustered indexes.
23. Parameter sniffing happens when SQL Server uses the first parameter’s value to generate and cache an execution plan.
24. A scalar UDF (User Defined Function) in SELECT disables parallelism. Hidden cost!
25. High logical reads usually mean missing indexes—SQL Server is reading many pages.
26. sys.dm_db_missing_index_details shows suggested missing indexes based on the workload.
27. All of those options (ALTER, DBCC FREEPROCCACHE, OPTION (RECOMPILE)) will trigger recompilation.
28. A covering index includes all needed columns, so no need to go back to the base table (avoids bookmark/key lookups).
29. WAITFOR DELAY '00:01:00' pauses query execution for 1 minute.
30. For large unsorted, non-indexed datasets, Hash Join is typically used—it doesn't require sorting or indexing.
31. DBCC FREEPROCCACHE clears procedure cache, used to reset execution plans
